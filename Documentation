# Data Analysis Agent – Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

**Data Analysis Agent** is an AI-powered platform that automates the data science workflow. It performs end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA), generates insights, detects anomalies, recommends features, and builds machine learning models automatically.

The system reduces manual effort for data scientists and analysts by converting raw datasets into actionable insights within minutes.

### Problem Statement

Traditional data analysis involves:

* Manual data cleaning and exploration
* Time-consuming visualization and profiling
* Trial-and-error model selection

This project automates these tasks to:

* Reduce analysis time from hours to minutes
* Improve productivity
* Provide quick decision support

---

## 2. Objectives

* Automate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Support multiple data formats (CSV, SQL, Parquet)
* Generate dataset profiling and statistics
* Detect anomalies automatically
* Suggest feature engineering techniques
* Recommend and train machine learning models (AutoML)
* Generate visualizations and reports
* Compress metadata using ScaleDown technique
* Provide REST API for integration
